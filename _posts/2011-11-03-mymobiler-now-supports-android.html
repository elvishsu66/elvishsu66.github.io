Well, few weeks ago, I told one of my clients to download "<a href="http://mymobiler.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MyMobiler</a>" 
as he wants to remote control his Windows Mobile Devices. I was surprised that it supports Android now...<br />

Thank you very much, "MyMobiler" team...
