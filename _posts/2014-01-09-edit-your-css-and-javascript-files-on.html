<a href="/assets/posts/blogger/2014-01-09-image-0000.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="Edit your CSS and JavaScript files on Google Drive" border="0" src="/assets/posts/blogger/2014-01-09-image-0000.png" height="150" title="Edit your CSS and JavaScript files on Google Drive" width="200" /></a></div>
Well, I like <a href="http://blogger.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blogger.com</a>. It is free and it allows me to play around the
    source code of templates. Since last year, I started to use customised
    templates and tweak some of the source codes. Believe or not, I actually
    enjoy it. Anyway, this is not what this post about. <br />
<br />
I use <a href="https://drive.google.com/" target="_blank" title="Google Drive">Google Drive</a> to host my CSS and JavaScript files for this blog site. I edit
    these files on my computer and let <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/drive" target="_blank" title="Access files on your computer from anywhere.">Google
      Drive application</a> to synchronise the files to the cloud. It sounds
    normal and I believe many other people would use the same way I do. However,
    what if I want to edit these text based files over Google Drive itself, on
    the browser? "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Yes, You Can!</span>" but you
    need third party <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/collection/drive_apps" target="_blank" title="Chrome Web Store">Google
      Drive Apps</a> to achieve the goal.<br />
<br />
I found two third party Google Drive apps, <a href="https://www.neutrondrive.com/" target="_top" title="Neutron Drive">Neutron
      Drive</a> and <a href="https://drivenotepad.appspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Drive
      Notepad</a>. Both are great apps and have their pros and cons. I started
    with Drive Notepad since it was the first app I found. But I use Neutron
    Drive more often because it integrates very well with Google Drive and it has
    file browser feature.<br />

<h4>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Highlights for both apps </span></h4>
<ul>
<li>Support for a variety of file types, including *.css, *js and *.html</li>
<li>Syntax highlighting for popular program languages</li>
<li>Support common used keyboard shortcuts</li>
<li>Google Drive revision control</li>
</ul>
<br />
Personally, I like to use Neutron Drive. It has more features than Drive Notepad such as file browser, html live view, themes and <a href="https://www.neutrondrive.com/blog/ftp-client" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FTP client</a>. However if you like clean and simple GUI, Drive Notepad would be a great fit. Well, if you're interested in letting Google Drive hosting your Blogger site's CSS or JavaScript files, check both apps out and let me know what you think in the comments!<br />
