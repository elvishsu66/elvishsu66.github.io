  <li>
    <span>Username should be <b>domain\username</b>.</span>
  </li>
  <li><span>Do not fill out domain in the VPN configuration.</span></li>
  <li>
    <span
      >Under the advanced option make sure you tick "<b>Use Point-to-Point encryption (MPPE)</b>" option. (see above
      screenshot)</span
