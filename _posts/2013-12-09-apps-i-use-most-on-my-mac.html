<a href="/assets/posts/blogger/2013-12-09-image-0000.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; display: inline !important; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img alt="Apps I use the most on my Mac" border="0" src="/assets/posts/blogger/2013-12-09-image-0000.png" title="Apps I use the most on my Mac" /></a><br />
Well, it is quite interesting. Most of the time I develop applications in Windows environments but I use Macbook Pro. I believe many Windows developers have similar situation as well.<br />
<br />
I am a Windows user since the first day I touched computers. I started to use Mac from 2011 because my previous employer wanted to be an authorised Apple reseller. Therefore I had to be an certified support engineer so I got a chance to start playing OS X and OS X server. So anyway, long story short, I became a full time Mac user since then.<br />
<br />
This article is going to show you the OS X apps I use the most on a daily basis. If you have any opinions, please feel free to post your comments.<br />

<h4>
Parallels Desktop</h4>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="/assets/posts/blogger/2013-12-09-image-0001.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="Parallels Desktop" border="0" src="/assets/posts/blogger/2013-12-09-image-0001.jpg" title="Parallels Desktop" /></a></div>
As I mentioned before, most of the time I develop applications in Windows environments. Many Mac user like to use bootcamp to boot into their desire environments but I feel it is quite a hassle for me. Therefore I decided to look for applications with good performance of virtualisation. There are few applications supporting virtualisation in OS X such as <a href="http://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/" target="_blank">Parallels Desktop</a>, <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/" target="_blank">VMWare Fusion</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank">Virtual Box</a>. I have tested them all and I decided to use Parallels Desktop. Why? Well, I like the interface to manage the virtual OS. It is that simple. Currently I have Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu 12.02 installed and both are working pretty well.<br />
<br />
You can find many articles with good comparison reports such as <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5861391/the-best-virtualization-app-for-mac-os-x" target="_blank">Life Hacker</a>, <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/1146000/virtualizationparent.html" target="_blank">Mac World</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://www.maclife.com/article/features/how_master_windows_virtualization_your_mac" target="_blank">Mac Life</a>. Anyway, if you have budget, try the <a href="http://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/" target="_blank">Parallels Desktop</a> otherwise <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank">Virtual Box</a> would be another good option.<br /><br />
<h4>
Adobe Photoshop Lightroom</h4>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="/assets/posts/blogger/2013-12-09-image-0002.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Adobe Photoshop Lightroom" border="0" src="/assets/posts/blogger/2013-12-09-image-0002.jpg" height="200" title="Adobe Photoshop Lightroom" width="200" /></a></div>
I am a photography enthusiast and most of time I take raw images. I have tried many open source photo editing applications such as <a href="http://www.digikam.org/" target="_blank">digikam</a>, <a href="http://www.darktable.org/" target="_blank">darktable</a> and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lightzoneproject.org/" target="_blank">LightZone</a>. I have to admit that open source applications are really awesome and some features definitely beat <a href="http://www.adobe.com/au/products/photoshop-lightroom.html" target="_blank">Adobe Photoshop Lightroom</a>&nbsp;or <a href="http://www.apple.com/au/aperture/" target="_blank">Aperture</a>. However, I've found out the quality of the processed images from open source applications didn't meet my standard. So eventually I decided to use Lightroom since it provides the results I like. Well, some people may argue with that, but it is just based on my personal taste.<br />

<h4>
Gimp for Mac</h4>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="/assets/posts/blogger/2013-12-09-image-0003.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="/assets/posts/blogger/2013-12-09-image-0003.png" /></a></div>
I use <a href="http://www.gimp.org/" target="_blank">Gimp</a> to edit images for web developments as well as the photos I have shot. So why not Photoshop? I have to say that <a href="https://creative.adobe.com/products/photoshop" target="_blank">Adobe Photoshop</a> is a fantastic application to edit images but the cost of the software is over my budget. In fact, I have also tried&nbsp;<a href="http://seashore.sourceforge.net/The_Seashore_Project/About.html" target="_blank">Seashore</a>, but it didn't go well with my taste bud.<br />
<br />
Although some <a href="http://www.elvishsu66.com/2013/01/installing-ufraw-plug-in-in-gimp.html" target="_blank">hiccups</a> occurred while installing the application but that was not a big issue. Gimp is an open source software which means it is free so as Seashore. However, base on my personal experience, <a href="http://www.gimp.org/features/" target="_blank">Gimp</a> has more powerful tools and features than <a href="http://seashore.sourceforge.net/The_Seashore_Project/Screenshots.html" target="_blank">Seashore</a>. Also&nbsp;Gimp supports many popular platforms (Linux, Windows, OS X, &nbsp;OpenSolaris and FreeBSD) but Seashore is only OS X friendly.<br />
<h4>
Xee</h4>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="/assets/posts/blogger/2013-12-09-image-0004.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Xee" border="0" src="/assets/posts/blogger/2013-12-09-image-0004.png" title="Xee" /></a></div>
I am not a big fan of using Preview when I started using OS X although it is a handy application. In fact, I just want to have a simple application to browse my photos. Well, as usual, I tried to search available software over <a href="https://www.google.com.au/search?q=best+photo+viewer+app+for+Mac" target="_blank">Google</a> and I found <a href="http://wakaba.c3.cx/s/apps/xee.html" target="_blank">Xee</a>.<br />
<br />
Xee is free and it has standard features I want however it does not have image and canvas resizing functions. So I sometimes using <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht2506" target="_blank">Preview</a> to do the simple jobs.<br />
<br />
<h4>
MPlayerX</h4>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="/assets/posts/blogger/2013-12-09-image-0005.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="MPlayerX" border="0" src="/assets/posts/blogger/2013-12-09-image-0005.png" title="MPlayerX" /></a></div>
I like to watch dramas and movies on my laptop but some of my video files have special encodings which <a href="http://www.apple.com/au/quicktime/" target="_blank">QuickTime</a> does not support. I have to say that <a href="http://mplayerx.org/" target="_blank">MPlayerX</a> is my most frequent used video player. It is simple to use and powerful to play. The best thing is that it can also stream <a href="http://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank">YouTube</a> video and audio.<br />
<br />
Although I use MPlayerX a lot but I also use <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html" target="_blank">VLC</a> media player when some hiccups turn up in MPlayerX. I have to admit that VLC media player has more dazzling features than MPlayerX but I believe MPlayerX is much simpler to use for many users.<br />
<br />
<h4>
Google Chrome and Firefox</h4>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="/assets/posts/blogger/2013-12-09-image-0006.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Google Chrome and Firefox" border="0" src="/assets/posts/blogger/2013-12-09-image-0006.png" title="Google Chrome and Firefox" /></a></div>
There are many popular web browsers in the Mac world such as <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a>, <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" target="_blank">Firefox</a>, <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/more" target="_blank">OminiWeb</a>, <a href="http://www.opera.com/" target="_blank">Opera</a>, and of course <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/" target="_blank">Safari</a>. Everyone has his or her own taste on using the web browser (including <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-au/internet-explorer/download-ie" target="_blank">IE</a>). I have a long history of using Firefox but I switched to Google Chrome when it got stable and mature. I also use Google Chrome on my iPad and iPhone since it sync all my personal settings and bookmarks across these three devices.<br />
<br />
On a daily basis, I use Google Chrome because I like its web store which has many extensions I like. However, as a web developer, I have to use all the browsers I mentioned above including Internet Explorer (in Windows) but most of the time I debug the code via Google Chrome because I like its interface. <br />
<br />
<h4>
TextWrangler</h4>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="/assets/posts/blogger/2013-12-09-image-0007.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="TextWrangler" border="0" src="/assets/posts/blogger/2013-12-09-image-0007.png" title="TextWrangler" /></a></div>
In Windows, I use <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank">Notepad++</a>&nbsp;to do simple text editing. In OS X, I use <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/" target="_blank">TextWrangler</a> from <a href="http://www.barebones.com/" target="_blank">Bare Bones Software</a> and you can download it from <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ch/app/id404010395" target="_blank">App Store</a> for free.<br />
<br />
I believe many people have experienced copying text from a web site and pasting it into their Microsoft Word or email message. All you need is plain-text but the clipboard holds strange formatting, links, unwanted graphics and spacing when you paste the text. You can use the build-in <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht2523" target="_blank">TextEdit</a> app to strip out those unwanted formatting but you need to&nbsp;choose <b><u>Format&nbsp;-> Make Plain Text</u></b> or press <b><u>Command-Shift-T</u></b>. Well, it is much easier to use TextWrangler, just copy and paste to get your plain-text. It also provide lots of features to fit you text editing needs. It is a great tool and it is free.<br />
<br />
<h4>
Aptana Studio</h4>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="/assets/posts/blogger/2013-12-09-image-0008.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Aptana Studio" border="0" src="/assets/posts/blogger/2013-12-09-image-0008.jpg" title="Aptana Studio" /></a></div>
<a href="http://www.aptana.com/" target="_blank">Aptana Studio</a> is a great tool to do the web development. When I am in Windows, I use <a href="http://www.nusphere.com/" target="_blank">PhpEd</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aptana.com/products/studio3/download" target="_blank">Apanda Studio</a>&nbsp;to develop web applications. When I'm in OS X, I only use <a href="http://www.aptana.com/products/studio3/download" target="_blank">Apanda Studio</a> to fill the gap between Windows and OS X. The IDE supports common web-application coding languages such as JavaScript, AJAX, PHP, and Ruby on Rails as well as HTML and CSS. The best part is that it supports Windows, OS X and Linux platforms and it is free. It also provides&nbsp;<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/" target="_blank">Eclipse</a> Plug-in version for those Eclipse fans.<br />
<br />
<h4>
CCleaner</h4>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="http://static.piriform.com/pf/icon/cc_128.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="CCleaner" border="0" src="http://static.piriform.com/pf/icon/cc_128.png" title="CCleaner" /></a></div>
I use <a href="https://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/download?mac" target="_blank">CCleaner</a> to clean caches, cookies and temporary files in both Windows and OS X.&nbsp;CCleaner can handle many of the tasks provided by OS X's Disk Utility, such as wiping out free space and repairing disk permissions. Unlike Windows version, the updates are not frequent but it is good enough to perform the cleaning tasks I need.<br />
<br />

<h4>
Evernote</h4>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="/assets/posts/blogger/2013-12-09-image-0009.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Evernote" border="0" src="/assets/posts/blogger/2013-12-09-image-0009.jpg" title="Evernote" /></a></div>
<a href="https://evernote.com/" target="_blank">Evernote</a> is not just a app for notes, it literally can do everything in our digital lives. I use it every day, on my Mac, iPad, iPhone, and even while browsing the web using <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/evernote-web-clipper/pioclpoplcdbaefihamjohnefbikjilc/related?hl=en" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a>.<br />
<br />
Most of time I use it for meeting notes, client notes, travel plans, recipes and my personal knowledge base. I recommend you to read this <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5964285/whats-all-the-fuss-about-evernote-why-do-people-use-it" target="_blank">article</a>.<br />

<h4>
Microsoft Office For Mac</h4>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="/assets/posts/blogger/2013-12-09-image-0010.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="Microsoft Office For Mac" border="0" src="/assets/posts/blogger/2013-12-09-image-0010.jpg" title="Microsoft Office For Mac" /></a></div>
I have been using Microsoft Office in Windows for many years. Well, I have to admit that I have to use <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/australia/mac" target="_blank">Microsoft Office for Mac</a>&nbsp;to write documents and presentations in Mac. I have tried <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/porting/mac/" target="_blank">Open Office for Mac</a>&nbsp;but the features do not satisfy me. Although the GUI of Mac version is slightly different from Windows version, but it still has the interface I like, Ribbon.<br />
<br />
You can have a look at this <a href="http://www.macworld.co.uk/macsoftware/reviews/?reviewid=3465053&amp;pagtype=allchandate" target="_blank">review</a>&nbsp;which compares&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/pages/" target="_blank">Pages</a>, Word and Google Docs. You can also have a look at this <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/208992/office_for_the_mac_the_same_only_different.html" target="_blank">article</a> to see the difference between Mac and Windows version.<br />
<br />
<h4>
In conclusion</h4>
I have many applications installed in my Mac such as <a href="http://www.skype.com/en/download-skype/skype-for-mac/" target="_blank">Skype</a>, <a href="http://line.naver.jp/en/" target="_blank">Line</a>, <a href="http://www.teamviewer.com/en/download/mac.aspx" target="_blank">TeamViewer</a>, <a href="http://nmap.org/book/inst-macosx.html" target="_blank">Nmap</a>, <a href="http://www.wireshark.org/download.html" target="_blank">Wireshark</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/skydrive/id522548761" target="_blank">SkyDrive</a>. I use them quite frequently but not as often as the applications I mentioned above. I believe I haven't discovered many other useful applications. If you have suggestions, please feel free to make comments.
