Pooh~~~ I haven't organised the blog page for ages... Well, not many clicks~~~<br />
Anyway, I tried to check emails at home with Ubuntu and found out the Evolution could not connect to our Exchange 2007 server. I found out it works well when I am in the office or VPN connection is on. Um... I think that will be my new task to find out what causes this... Or... If any one reads this post, I would appreciated some comments or suggestions for this issue.
