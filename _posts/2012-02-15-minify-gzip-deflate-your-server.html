Today, I was browsing around the web and found some interesting articles which are related to <a href="http://elvishsu66.blogspot.com.au/2012/02/minify-extjs-on-fly.html" target="_blank">minify extjs on the fly</a>.&nbsp;Well, if I can minify the server response and deflate it, that would be even faster to deliver to client's browser? So I decided to give it a go.<br />
<br />
Bang~ It is faster than just minify the content. But so far I just tested with Apache server as it is most used http server in my projects.&nbsp;I just added the following code in my .htaccess file<br />
<br />
{% highlight js %}
# compress text, html, javascript, css, xml:
AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/plain
AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/html
AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/xml
AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/css
AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/xml
AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/xhtml+xml
AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/rss+xml
AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/javascript
AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/x-javascript
{% endhighlight %}

<br />
By the way, you may want to enable the <b>mod_deflate.so</b> in your <b>httpd.conf</b> to make it work.<br />
<br />
Anyway, have a look at&nbsp;<a href="http://betterexplained.com/articles/how-to-optimize-your-site-with-gzip-compression/" target="_blank">How To Optimize Your Site With GZIP Compression</a>. It&nbsp;really gives a heads up. So you may want to have a try on your projects.
